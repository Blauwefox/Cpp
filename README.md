# Cpp
03FEB2016
After playing with Python for a month I went into C and C++ courtesy to "Arduino Platform and C programming" Coursera online 
course by Prof Ian Harris (University of California, Irvine). Arduino gives me instant gratification, in terms of 
"command in = result out" without hassle. Kudos. 

Syntax is different, but on the whole it is less arcane after Python.
